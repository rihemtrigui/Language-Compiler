# Language-Compiler
# Description
Language Compiler is a simple C-based compiler for a custom Tiny Language (TL). This project includes lexical analysis, parsing, and basic symbol table management for the TL language. The compiler can process source code written in TL and performs basic checks like identifying keywords, operators, and handling symbol table entries.
# Features
Lexical Analysis: Identification of keywords, operators, and tokens in TL code.
Symbol Table Management: Tracks identifiers and literals within the TL program.
Basic File Handling: Reads source code from a file and outputs the analysis results.
Error Handling: Basic error detection for invalid tokens and incomplete structures.
Prerequisites
# GCC or any standard C compiler.
Standard C libraries: stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, ctype.h.
